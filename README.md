# Weather Sniper Bot

Polymarket weather market trading bot that exploits slow-moving temperature markets using multi-source forecasts.

## Strategy

**Sniper:** Buy cheap temperature bucket outcomes ($0.007-$0.15) that our ensemble forecast strongly favors. Hold to resolution for 9x-142x returns.

**Spread:** Buy multiple adjacent temperature buckets with decaying allocation. Profit even if actual temp is ±1°C from forecast.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Copy env file
cp .env.example .env

# 3. Run in paper mode (default, safe)
python dashboard.py

# 4. Run single scan
python dashboard.py --once

# 5. Run live (real money)
python dashboard.py --live
```

## Architecture

## Weather Models Used

| Source | Models | Key Required |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Open-Meteo | ECMWF, GFS, ICON, JMA, GEM | No (free) |
| OpenWeatherMap | OWM proprietary | Yes (free tier) |
| weather.gov | NWS (US only) | No |

## Paper Mode

Default mode. Simulates all trades, tracks P&L, generates signals without spending real money. Perfect for testing and parameter tuning.

```bash
python dashboard.py --paper --balance 10.0
```

## Deploy

### Railway
```bash
railway up
```

### Local
```bash
python dashboard.py
```

## Configuration

All settings in `.env` — see `.env.example` for full list.

Key parameters:
- `TRADING_MODE`: paper or live
- `SNIPER_MAX_ENTRY_PRICE`: max price to buy (default $0.15)
- `MIN_EDGE_TO_ENTER`: minimum edge required (default 10%)
- `KELLY_FRACTION`: Kelly sizing conservatism (default 0.15)
- `SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: how often to scan (default 60s)

## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

Already a pro? Just edit this README.md and make it your own. Want to make it easy? [Use the template at the bottom](#editing-this-readme)!

## Add your files

* [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/web_editor/#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/repository/web_editor/#upload-a-file) files
* [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/topics/git/add_files/#add-files-to-a-git-repository) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/ramco-group/jju.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Integrate with your tools

* [Set up project integrations](https://gitlab.com/ramco-group/jju/-/settings/integrations)

## Collaborate with your team

* [Invite team members and collaborators](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/members/)
* [Create a new merge request](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_request)

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thanks to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README

Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going.
